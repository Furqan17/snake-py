# snake-py
Inspired by the [Classic Snake Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre))    
This game was coded in Python (3.6.3) and utilises the [Pygame library](https://www.pygame.org/news)  

## :wrench: Build & Installation 
1.) Pygame requires [Python](https://www.python.org/), if you don't already have it, you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/), Use python 3.6.1 or greater, because it is much friendlier to newbies, and additionally *runs faster.*

2.) The best way to install pygame is with the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) tool (which is what python uses to install packages). Note, this comes with python in recent versions. Use the --user flag to tell it to install into the home directory, rather than globally.

3.) In console `python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user`  

4.) Open `game.py` and run

### Note:

Controls the icon image in the pygame window, I have not uploaded the icon so python will give you an **error**. Before running `game.py` comment out these 2 lines (23,24) or *alternatively* add your own image.
