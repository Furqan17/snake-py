# snake-py
classic snake :snake: game  
This game was coded in Python (3.6.3) and utilises the Pygame library  

## Build & Installation 
Pygame requires [Python](https://www.python.org/), if you don't already have it, you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/), Use python 3.6.1 or greater, because it is much friendlier to newbies, and additionally *runs faster.*

The best way to install pygame is with the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) tool (which is what python uses to install packages). Note, this comes with python in recent versions. Use the --user flag to tell it to install into the home directory, rather than globally.

In *console*:  
`python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user`  

Open `game.py` and run
